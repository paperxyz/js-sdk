feat(embedded-wallet-service-sdk): Add ability to generate wallet with no user recovery code required
feat(embedded-wallet-service-sdk): Add ability to override the recovery code for new user rather than using Paper's pre-generated recovery codes.
Note: By overriding the recovery code generation, user's will not be able to user the `withpaper.com/wallet` page anymore
