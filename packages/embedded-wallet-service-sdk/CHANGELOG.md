### Patch Changes

- 4323447: feat: add `isNewDevice` to `sendPaperEmailLoginOtp` function
  Note that if you're asking the user for recovery code, checking for `isNewDevice === true` is now more accurate than checking for `!isNewUser === true` when deciding whether to ask for recovery code. In particular, some existing user (`!isNewUser`) will no longer be required to enter their recovery phrase again when logging back into an existing device.

  Passing in a `recoveryCode` even when `isNewDevice === false` will still work.

  feat: allow users logging in and out of same device to not require recovery phrase

  security: lock iframe post-messaging to paper domain

  internal: removed `AuthStoredTokenReturnType` type.
  remove unused `Modal.ts` and `UiCommunicator` files.
